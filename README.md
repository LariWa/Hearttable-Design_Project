# Hearttable Design Project

This project was developed during the course _Media Technology and Interaction Design_ with Ritty Thomas, Jessie Liu, Tor Sundman and Benjamin Esdor from 30.08.2021 till 29.10.2021. The design theme was _Designing for a World of Introverts_.

We came up with the design idea _Heartable_ - an interactive table, which connects people while using the table. The goal was to create an easier way for people to interact throughout their daily life.  
 In this project we explored the Double Diamond Design Process and used various methods for designing, idea finding and evaluation. Have a look our [Workbook](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEtWeoU2L8/HIq0ccwuY2_BT41Cc65ZEw/view?website#2:workbook) for more information on the project.
